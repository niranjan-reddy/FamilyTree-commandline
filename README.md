This Java commandline project/application will read the family tree from the input file "/data/ancestry.info" and load in memory. It will wait for user input to perform the following operations:

            READ
            SEARCH
            ADD
                    People, Relations, etc. to the Family/Ancestry Tree both in-memory and on file.


There is one JUnit covering several test scenarios as well.

You may update code as needed and suggest for merge.
